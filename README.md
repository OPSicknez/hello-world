# hello-world
Just Another Repository 
i obviously got this from the guide 
and im writing about myself 
iwell i want to learn coding obviously
but i know nothing about 
it i know im a pleb 
but im trying to get a head start
im not a normal person 
i know a edgy statement to make
but it is true i am not a generic clone of everyone else
like everyone else is 
im a little stoned while writing this so sorry for that
i think thats all for now might come back in a hour 
depending on if i think of something good probably earlier
